# Introduction

This Terraform code project provides an example of how to deploy a .NET sample application to AWS Lambda using S3 and API Gateway. The sample application is a simple C# function that takes an input string and returns it as output. The application is deployed to Lambda as a ZIP package stored in an S3 bucket and is accessible through API Gateway.
